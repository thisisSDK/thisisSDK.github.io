This post is timely in that it's about 4 days past due. 

Coming into this program I was killing it. Days were regimented - schedule down to the times I walked the dog. The structure helped me move forward and keep procrastination to a minimum. I was always either ahead or on time and understanding the material as I went. It was great! 

So what went wrong? 

As a firm believer in structure, I think having a plan is key to success in an online program. However, my mistake is leaving so little room for error. When Thanksgiving rolled around, I was knee deep in my first project. Things moved along well but I found that my site I was trying to scrap was generated with JavaScript and thus incompatible with the gem I was required to use. 

The snowball started and I didn't even realize it. 

That week, I had planned to have my project finished before we headed to see family - against my better judgement, I told myself I could keep working on it throughout that week and have it ready for classes to begin the next Monday. 

The expected happened and the project remained about 90% finished by the time class resumed. After the holiday, a deluge of life events started pelting our family. Sick dog, dad falling off the roof (in true Clark Griswald style), grandmother fell, cousin in the hospital, uncle fell and was hospitalized. Add this to life in general and I was quickly overwhelmed and behind. Looking at my military-like schedule and the growing to do list, I became more overwhelmed and discouraged, making it that much more difficult to dive back in. 

Finally, I knew something had to give and I notified my professors that I needed to take care of a few things and would be taking my work in stride these next few weeks. 

Relieving that  pressure allowed me to take care of the issues at hand and, though I'm still about 2 weeks behind, I am finally returning to a place where I can be an active participant in my cohort. 

Looking forward, I'm choosing to actively unpack my schedule, relieving the pressure on making everything fit in an effort to ensure the classes that are so important to my development don't fall behind again. 

Here it goes.
