You're reading this and you've either been there or likely soon will be. Striking up a conversation wtih someone and you tell them you're learning to code. They come back equal parts impressed and confused. What does it mean? What do you do with code? Doesn't that mean apps and stuff? Websites? You might even hear about the kid in the basement down the street who "is a coder." Learning to code is something most people can't even fathom. Think about it. 

So why do it? 

In my case, I had a taste of tech and never wanted to let it go. 

Problems have always excited me, Raised a tinkerer, I always had to come up with creative solutions to whatever life handed me. You could say it's ingrained in who I am as a person. 

Through business, startups, the entertainment business - I've always wondered how I could make things better and frequently came up with ideas but never had the know how to put my technical solutions together. 

That ends now. 

In short, I want to build beautifully simple solutions that solve life's little problems. 

Here I am. On the road to building what's next. 

Coding. Learning. Breaking. Innovating.
